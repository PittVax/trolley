The TreeAge Object Interface exposes no way to set the workspace path to a
location outside of the treeage application's installed directories.

In order to use the tools provided in this package, either:
- clone the git project into $HOME/treeage/workspace
- create symlinks from that location to this package
- copy the necessary input files (trees, data, etc) into the treeage workspace
- use absolute paths

All input paths given to taoi modules will be relative to this workspace path
