The TreeAge Object Interface exposes no way to set the workspace path to a
location outside of the treeage application's installed directories.

In order to use the tools provided in this package, either:
- clone the git project into $HOME/treeage/workspace
- create symlinks from that location to this package
- copy the necessary input files (trees, data, etc) into the treeage workspace
- use absolute paths

All input paths given to taoi modules will be relative to this workspace path 


PyYAML:
- must be installed with jython
- recommend using a virtual environment for jython dependencies

TreeAge:
- it may be necessary to start the TreeAgePro interface once "as administrator"
  * attempting to install a plugin within treeage prompted privilege escalation
  * this may be an osx-specific issue
- it may be beneficial to increase the amount of memory available to treeage
  * this is done in the TreeAgePro.ini file (or, possibly, within the settings
    of the application.  On my system the file is:
    /Applications/TreeAgePro/TreeAgePro.app/Contents/MacOS/TreeAgePro.ini
  * Original settings were:
    -XX:MaxPermSize=256m
    -Xms128m
    -Xmx1024m
  * Doubling these gives:
    -XX:MaxPermSize=512m
    -Xms256m
    -Xmx2048m
